# Proof-of-Concept Web-based GameBoy Emulator deployed using GitHub Actions to AWS Amplify

### Check out the app [here!](https://dev1880.dycxslhhfqvr7.amplifyapp.com/)

This repository contains the code for building, testing, and deploying a web-based GameBoy emulator, including developing a demonstration GameBoy game using GBDK.
> This was done as part of an assessment for Fullstack Academy. The following information is hypothetical only for the purposes of this assessment.

This project depends on [colla00/FSA-DevOps-CapstoneCodeBase](https://github.com/colla00/FSA-DevOps-CapstoneCodeBase) for proper deployment.

### Project Details:
This project is being developed by the FSA Capstone Team for Nintendo European Research & Development SAS (NERD). The purpose of the project is to develop a browser-based Nintendo Game Boy emulator that will enable users to play classic games through a web browser, and allow Nintendo to monetize their retro games.

The team comprises four members: Ethan Page, Alexis Collier, Haider Shaghati, and Donald Hare.
