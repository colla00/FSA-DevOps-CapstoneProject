# GameBoy Emulator CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains the code for building, testing, and deploying a web-based GameBoy emulator using a CI/CD pipeline. The pipeline is designed to automate the process of building and deploying the emulator, making it easier to maintain and update.

This emulator is based on "binjgb," created by binji, and uses GBDK for the development tools.

Credit for the original emulator goes to:
